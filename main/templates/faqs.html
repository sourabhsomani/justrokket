                                Also pre-registration cannot be used in any college other than the one for which it is issued.

                                <p>Actually nothing much! You only need to ensure that there is no discrepancy in the offer extended to you by the college as part of the admission offer provided to you through email or a printed copy, etc. In the rare case that there is one, the same needs to be brought to our notice asap so that we may work towards resolving the discrepancy.<br>
                                Ensure that you are completing all steps required for selection confirmation by the institution, like for example any further assessments, submission of documents, fees, etc. As soon as the institution confirms your admission, the scholarship is also confirmed.<br>
                                Also, you may need to submit a copy of the scholarship voucher (issued by us) while submitting your â€˜â€™proof of eligibilityâ€™â€™ documents (or their copies) to the college. The procedure may vary slightly as per as per the institution. The most common procedure is to submit the voucher in the admission office or the accounts office.</p>

                                <p>Of course! We are committed to your satisfaction and will cancel your pre-registration and refund the pre-registration amount paid to us.<br>
                                You should inform us of your request for cancellation of pre-registration and refund of the pre-registration amount, along with reason for the same, through your user account.<br>
                                The maximum period to which you can apply for a refund of the pre-registration amount is till 15 days after the session of the institution, to which your were admitted, has started.<br>
                                Please note that while we try to process a refund request within 15 days of its receipt, the refund process can be lengthy at times due to the fact that we have to notify the institution of your withdrawal and get confirmation from them that you did not enrol.</p>
